# DeezerRPC

## Notes on the project
I have forked the project mainly to update the packages.
I may add features when I have the time.
Contributions are welcome.

## Description

Deezer integrated with the Discord Rich Presence.

This project is not supported and created by Deezer.

This application opens the web version of the Deezer application and performs background operations to collect data from
the current song. It does not use the Deezer API, everything is collected from the DOM itself.

Shows status on Discord and also supports global media keys.

Supports songs (including ones that user upload), radios and podcasts.

I don't understand why Deezer has not implemented this until today...

## Installation

1. Download the correct release for your operating system. (**exe** = Windows, **dmg** = macOS, **AppImage** = Linux)
2. Install the application that you have downloaded.

## Usage

When opening the app for the first time, you will have to log in with your Deezer account. **IT'S THE OFFICIAL DEEZER
PAGE, THIS APPLICATION DOES NOT COLLECT ANY DATA FROM THE USERS.**

Discord needs to be running for rich presence to work, otherwise you will have to reopen the application.

Update of rich presence is automatic, does not require any user action.

This application has some options in the system notification area:

* **Toggle**: Shows or hides the DeezerRPC window.
* **Player**: Manually control basic player actions outside main window.
* **Settings**: Miscellaneous options like controlling how the window is minimized and checking for updates on startup.
* **Check for updates**: Check if there is a new version available.
* **DeezerRPC [version]**: Open this GitHub page.
* **Exit**: Closes the application.

## Global Shortcuts

This application has some global shortcuts (check on your keyboard).

* **PLAY**: Play or pause the current song.

* **NEXT**: Go to the next song.

* **PREVIOUS**: Go to the previous song.
